This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the working directory is not correctly set. The provided Dockerfile attempts to run a Python app, but the CMD instruction fails because it assumes the script is in the root directory, while the COPY instruction places it in the current working directory.  The solution demonstrates how to set the working directory correctly using the WORKDIR instruction before running the application.
